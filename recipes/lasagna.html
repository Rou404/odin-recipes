    <ul>
        Steps:
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Meat Sauce:
            <ul>
                <li>In a large skillet, brown the ground beef and Italian sausage over medium heat until cooked through.</li>
                <li>Add the chopped onion and garlic, sauté until they are soft and translucent.</li>
                <li>in the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste. Add dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and pepper. Simmer for about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Make the Béchamel Sauce:
            <ul>
                <li>In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.</li>
                <li>Stir in the flour to create a roux. Cook for a couple of minutes, stirring constantly.</li>
                <li>Slowly whisk in the milk, making sure there are no lumps.</li>
                <li>Add nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Continue to cook and stir until the sauce thickens, about 10-15 minutes. Remove from heat.            </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        
        <li>Preheat the Oven: 
            Preheat your  oven to 350°F (175°C).
        </li>
        <li>Assemble the Lasagna:
            <ul>
                <li>Spread a thin layer of the meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish to prevent sticking.</li>
                <li>Place a layer of cooked lasagna noodles over the sauce.</li>
                <li>Spread about a third of the meat sauce over the noodles.</li>
                <li>Drizzle a quarter of the béchamel sauce over the meat sauce.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle with a third of the mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses.</li>
                <li>Repeat this layering process two more times, ending with a final layer of noodles, béchamel sauce, and remaining cheese.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Bake:
            <ul>
                <li>Cover the baking dish with foil and bake for 25 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25-30 minutes, or until the top is golden and bubbly.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Rest and Serve:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Let the lasagna rest for 10-15 minutes before cutting into it. This allows it to set and makes it easier to serve.</li>
            <li>Garnish with fresh basil leaves if desired.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Enjoy: Serve your homemade lasagna with a fresh garden salad and some garlic bread for a delicious and satisfying meal. Enjoy!</li>
